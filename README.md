# GH_Solar
Annual hourly solar irradiation on meshed surfaces.
See this publication for more info: http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BSO2016/p1059.pdf 

Copy the [.gha](https://github.com/christophwaibel/GH_Solar/blob/master/GrasshopperEnergyTools.gha) file into your Rhino Grasshopper components folder. You can find the folder by typing _"GrasshopperFolders"_, _"Components"_ into your Rhino command line.

Try out the *.gh file as examples:
* [Annual hourly irradiation](https://github.com/christophwaibel/GH_Solar/blob/master/160908_Tutorial02_SolarTool.gh) <br>
Simple example on how to perform annual solar irradiation calculation on surfaces (roof and facade). 
* [Facade optimization](https://github.com/christophwaibel/GH_Solar/blob/master/170324_solaroptimizationexample_04.gh) <br>
Facade optimization example with Galapagos. Maximizing annual irradiation in kWh/a on the solar shading - e.g. for placing PV.
